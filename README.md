# Set Game

The family friendly card game, recreated using React.  Find as many sets of 3 cards within 2 minutes or play against your friends and see who can find more sets within that time limit.

### Rules
- Each card features 4 features - color, shape, count, and fill
- The goal is to get a set of cards where each of the features are different or the same. For example, the following would be a set because they all have the same count, color, shape, and they're all a different fill: 
  - 1 purple cylinder half filled
  - 1 purple cylinder empty
  - 1 purple cylinder full
- Try and get as many sets as you can within 2 minutes

### How to begin
- Either signup or login in using our **demo account (username: demo, password: demo)**
- Click play to play single player to play for a highscore or choose multiplayer to play against your friends
- In multiplayer, each player chooses a key.  When they find a set, they push their respective key, which pauses the timer.  They have 3 seconds to click the set or else the timer will continue.
